<h3> CyberKnife</h3>
The CyberKnife System is the only radiation delivery system that features a linear accelerator (linac) directly mounted on a robot to deliver the high-energy x-rays used in radiation therapy. The robot moves around the subject, to deliver radiation doses from potentially thousands of unique beam angles, significantly expanding the possible positions to concentrate radiation to the tumor while minimizing dose to surrounding healthy tissue. This robotic delivery and real-time image guidance have set the standard for delivery precision and enable stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatments for the full range of tumor types. This model resembles the real CyberKnife model with Kuka Manipulator.

<h3> SARAC </h3>
SARAC(Socially Assistive Robot for Autistic Children) is a smart solution that will assist kids with mental and social limitations to overcome the challenges they face in day-to-day life. It is focused mainly on children facing Autism and targeted  for children affected by Autism Age group ðŸ¡ª 3 to 14+ years.
It gives a holistic approach for coping with autism.Using robots with Autstic kids in past have shown improvement in attention span, ability to understand social cues.e.g .children's average joint attention scores also improved between the first and last days with the robot(Jibo), increasing by 33% before dropping slightly 30 days after the study ended.
  
<h3> Mobile Robots </h3>
This contains models of different robots with different drives for example differential drive and castor drive.
